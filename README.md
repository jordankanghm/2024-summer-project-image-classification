# 2024-Summer-Machine-Learning-Project
This repository stores all machine learning projects I have worked on during the summer of 2024.
I plan to do three projects: Image Classification, Stock Price Prediction, and Sentiment Analysis. The dependencies for all projects can be found in the requirements file.

## Image Classification
I decided to conduct image classification on the MNIST dataset comprising handwritten digits. The dataset consists of 60,000 training and 10,000 testing images and labels. The image-classification directory shows all the work I have done, including data preprocessing, training and testing models, and hyperparameter tuning. The final model produced the following test scores.

Accuracy: 0.9907
Precision: 0.9909
Recall: 0.9905
F1: 0.9907

## Stock Price Prediction
I decided to conduct stock price prediction using Apple's stock price data in 2024. The dataset consists of 250 data points, consisting of features such as high, low and closing price. The stock-price-prediction directory shows all the work I have done, including data preprocessing, and training and testing models. The final model produced the following test scores.

Mean Squared Error: 0.02743
R-squared: 0.9999
