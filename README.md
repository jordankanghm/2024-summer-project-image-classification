# 2024-Summer-Machine-Learning-Project
This repository stores all machine learning projects I have worked on during the summer of 2024.
I plan to do three projects: Image Classification, Stock Price Prediction, and Sentiment Analysis.

## Image Classification
I decided to conduct image classification on the MNIST dataset comprising handwritten digits. The image-classification directory shows all the work I have done, including data preprocessing, training and testing models, and hyperparameter tuning. The final model produced the following test scores.

Accuracy: 0.9907
Precision: 0.9909
Recall: 0.9905
F1: 0.9907
